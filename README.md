# RestaurantTegal

Welcome to **RestaurantTegal**!  
This project is a practical exploration of **Webpack** and **JavaScript module dependency management**.

## Purpose

- Learn how to bundle JavaScript files using Webpack.
- Understand how modules interact and depend on each other.
- Build a simple restaurant-themed web app as a hands-on example.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Use `npx webpack serve` for live check. (If you want to make a new web based on mine!)
4. Check my website in the link available later.

## Technologies

- JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
- Webpack
